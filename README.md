This  code is for an interactive proof protocol, where one party (Cyprian) proves to another party (Alex) that they know the square root of a number modulo n without revealing the square root itself. 
This concept is important in cryptographic protocols and zero-knowledge proofs.
The code includes functions for computing the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the modular inverse, and it utilizes these functions in the context of an interactive proof protocol.
